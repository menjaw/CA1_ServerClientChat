            <p>I liked Jens as an educator. I have recieved some education on some of 
                these subjects before, however never really grasped it before now, and 
                i felt i came into this only having heard of the words Thread and TCP 
                connection etc., but otherwise a blank slate. But now i actually feel 
                quite comfortable in using them.<br>
                The CA1 does a good job of making us utilize all the aspects of the 
                lessons we've had so far, even if it is quite comprehensive.</p>
