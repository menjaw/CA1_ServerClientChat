            <h1>System Design</h1>
            This system is divided up in two parts, the Server and the Client.
            Two different clients were implemented, one utilizing a GUI, the 
            other using plain console Input/Output.
            <h3>Server</h3>
            <p>The main class for the Server part is called ChatServer. This class has a
                public CopyOnWriteArrayList which stores the online users, and a public
                ExecutorService in the form of a newCachedThreadPool, that handles all
                running of threads in the server. Threads in the server system include:
                one for each new User loggin on the system, one for each ConnectionHandler,
                and one for the MessageConsumer. When the ChatServer is started using
                the startServer() method, a socket is bound to the chosen host and port,
                then the MessageConsumer is executed and finally a new connectHandler is
                started for each new connection accepted on the socket.</p>

            <p>The MessageConsumer has an ArrayBlockingQueue of Message, which all
                messages are added to by the server, and the MessageConsumer then handles
                sending them to their reciever. In order to add Messages to the queue, a
                Message class was made having both a sender and reciever of type User, and
                a String containing the data to be sent. The User class has a socket,
                username, writer and reader. Furthermore it has a function called
                write(String msg), making it easier to write to the separate users by
                simply calling this method on each reciever.</p>

            <p> The ConnectionHandler class extends Runnable in order to run it in a new
                Thread for each new connection. In the run() method a reader and writer
                is used to check the LOGIN input, and write a FAIL message if the name
                already exists. If it doesn't, a new User is made and given the new
                connection as well as being assinged the name given in the LOGIN input.
                The User is then added to the list of users in the ChatServer, and then
                an OK message is written with all active users.</p>

            <p> The ChatServer also extends Observable, and the User class implements
                Observer. This is done in order to alert the users when a new user joins
                or an existing user disconnects, by calling our setChangedAndNotify(Notification n)
                method which calls setChanged() and notifyObservers(n), thereby calling
                the update method in each User. <br>
                Notification is a class we made in order to make these notifications, and
                they have a User and an enum with the notification type(UPDATE or DELETE).</p>
