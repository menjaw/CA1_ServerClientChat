        <h1>System Design</h1>
        This system is divided up in two parts, the Server and the Client.
        <h3>Server</h3>
        The main class for the Server part is called ChatServer. This class has a 
        public CopyOnWriteArrayList which stores the online users, and a public 
        ExecutorService in the form of a newCachedThreadPool, that handles all 
        running of threads in the server. Threads in the server system include: 
        one for each new User loggin on the system, one for each ConnectionHandler,
        and one for the MessageConsumer. When the ChatServer is started using 
        the startServer() method, a socket is bound to the chosen host and port, 
        then the MessageConsumer is executed and finally a new connectHandler is 
        started for each new connection accepted on the socket.
        <br>
        The MessageConsumer has an ArrayBlockingQueue of Message, which all 
        messages are added to by the server, and the MessageConsumer then handles 
        sending them to their reciever. In order to add Messages to the queue, a 
        Message class was made having both a sender and reciever of type User, and
        a String containing the data to be sent. The User class has a socket, 
        username, writer and reader. Furthermore it has a function called 
        write(String msg), making it easier to write to the separate users by 
        simply calling this method on each reciever.
        
        <h3>Clients</h3>
