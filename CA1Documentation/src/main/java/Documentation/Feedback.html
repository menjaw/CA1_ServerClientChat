        I liked Jens as an educator. I have recieved some education on some of 
        these subjects before, however never really grasped it before now, and 
        i felt i came into this only having heard of the words Thread and TCP 
        connection etc., but otherwise a blank slate. But now i actually feel 
        quite comfortable in using them.
        The CA1 does a good job of making us utilize all the aspects of the 
        lessons we've had so far, even if it is quite comprehensive.
